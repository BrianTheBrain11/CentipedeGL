Work to be done:

* Add sound - Find a simple sound engine that works well
* Add the other bugs - Add the other bugs
* Proper game over - Add a proper game over and possibly high schore screen

I began this project as a way to test my opengl capabilities. I would like to submit this code as a test of my abilities. I will continue to improve this until I have a completely gameplay accurate recreation of centipede.
